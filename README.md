# zkHuman - Zero Knowledge Human Verification

A privacy-preserving human verification system that proves humanity without revealing personal data, built as a demonstration of Zero Knowledge Proof applications.

## 🚀 What is zkHuman?

zkHuman is a cryptographic protocol that verifies human behavior through Zero Knowledge Proofs, eliminating the need for traditional CAPTCHAs while maintaining complete privacy. The system combines behavioral biometrics, cognitive challenges, and cryptographic commitments to create verifiable proofs of humanity.

## 🔐 Zero Knowledge Architecture

- **No Personal Data**: Zero collection of identifiable information
- **Behavioral Hashing**: SHA-256 commitment schemes for interaction patterns  
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: Verifiable humanity claims without data exposure
- **Privacy-First**: Complete anonymity with mathematical guarantees

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Cryptography**: Web Crypto API with SHA-256 hashing
- **UI Components**: Lucide React icons
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development

## 🎯 ZK Application Ideas & Concepts

This project demonstrates just one application of Zero Knowledge Proofs. Here are more ideas for ZK-powered applications:

- **Selective Disclosure**: Share specific data points without full profile exposure

### 🏥 Healthcare & Research
- **Medical Privacy**: Prove health conditions without revealing medical records
- **Anonymous Clinical Trials**: Participate in research while protecting identity
- **Genetic Privacy**: Prove hereditary traits without DNA exposure
- **Mental Health Verification**: Access services without stigma or records

### 🎓 Education & Certification
- **Anonymous Peer Review**: Verify reviewer qualifications without bias
- **Private Academic Records**: Prove GPA ranges without exact scores
- **Skill Verification**: Demonstrate competencies without revealing learning path
- **Anonymous Surveys**: Collect research data with verified demographics

### 🏢 Enterprise & Compliance
- **Supply Chain Privacy**: Verify ethical sourcing without revealing suppliers

## 🔧 Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zkhuman.git
cd zkhuman

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Pattern Challenge**: Tests human memory and cognitive patterns
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Tracks mouse movements and interaction timing
3. **Cognitive Verification**: Presents reasoning challenges with time constraints
4. **Cryptographic Proof**: Generates SHA-256 commitments from behavioral data
5. **Zero Knowledge Verification**: Proves humanity without revealing methods

## 🔬 Technical Implementation

The system uses several cryptographic primitives:

- **Commitment Schemes**: Pedersen commitments for behavioral data
- **Hash Functions**: SHA-256 for data integrity and privacy
- **Entropy Collection**: Mouse movements and timing analysis
- **Challenge-Response**: Interactive proofs of cognitive ability
- **Behavioral Biometrics**: Pattern analysis without storage

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is built for static hosting and can be deployed to:

- Vercel
- Netlify  
- GitHub Pages
- IPFS
- Any static hosting provider

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- All cryptographic operations use Web Crypto API
- No personal data is stored or transmitted
- Behavioral patterns are immediately hashed
- Proofs are verifiable but not reversible
- System designed for privacy-first architecture
